# Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

## 1. Parser Failures (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Fabric Parser Crash
- **Issue**: Tree-sitter crashes with index out of bounds on larger Go files
- **Error**: `range end index 1416 out of range for slice of length 0`
- **File**: `examples/vulnerable_chaincode.go`
- **Impact**: Cannot analyze real-world Fabric chaincodes
- **Root Cause**: Likely mismatch between tree-sitter version and grammar version

### Solana Parser Failure  
- **Issue**: Parser fails on all Solana Rust files
- **Error**: `Parse("Failed to parse Solana program")`
- **Impact**: Solana analysis is completely broken
- **Root Cause**: Parser is not properly initialized or grammar is missing

## 2. Missing Core Features

### No Test Suite
- Unit tests exist but no integration tests
- No end-to-end test suite
- No CI test coverage reporting

### No Release Pipeline
- GitHub Actions release workflow exists but never tested
- No automated binary building
- No crates.io publishing setup

## 3. Security Concerns

### Unchecked Panic Points
- Multiple `unwrap()` calls that could panic
- No proper error boundaries
- Could crash on malformed input

### No Input Validation
- File size limits not enforced
- Could consume excessive memory on large files
- No timeout on analysis operations

## 4. Documentation Gaps

### Missing API Documentation
- No rustdoc comments on public APIs
- No examples in documentation
- Contributing guide needs expansion

### Incomplete Feature Documentation
- ERC token standards are stubs
- Ethereum support incorrectly advertised
- AI features not fully documented

## Recommended Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Parser Issues** ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
   - ✅ Added error handling for tree-sitter crashes
   - ✅ Fixed Fabric parser index out of bounds errors
   - ⚠️  Solana parser disabled due to version conflicts
   - ✅ Added parser tests

2. **Add Integration Tests** ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Test each platform with real examples
   - ✅ Add regression tests for found bugs
   - ⏳ Set up code coverage (pending)

3. **Security Hardening** ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
   - ✅ Replaced many `unwrap()` with proper error handling
   - ✅ Added safe regex creation utilities
   - ⏳ Add input validation (in progress)
   - ⏳ Add resource limits (pending)

4. **Documentation Sprint** ⏳ IN PROGRESS
   - ⏳ Add rustdoc to all public items
   - ✅ Created ARCHITECTURE.md
   - ✅ Updated README with accurate information

## Recent Improvements

### Parser Fixes
- Fixed tree-sitter index out of bounds in Fabric analyzer
- Added comprehensive bounds checking for code snippet extraction
- Temporarily disabled Rust parser due to version conflicts
- Made complexity analyzer language-agnostic

### Error Handling
- Created safe regex utilities with proper error handling
- Added error handling macros for common patterns
- Updated performance analyzer to handle regex failures gracefully
- Replaced critical unwrap() calls that could cause panics

### Testing
